## Prerequisites

- **JDK 11** (or later)
- **Kotlin 2.1+**
- A valid API key from [TheMovieDB](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started)

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/riadmahi/MovieNow.git
   cd MovieNow
   ```

2. **Generate Your API Key on TheMovieDB**

   - Visit [TheMovieDB](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started).
   - Sign up or log in.
   - Navigate to the *API* section in your account and generate a new API key.

3. **Place the API Key in `local.properties`**

   In the project root, create (or update) a file named `local.properties` and add the following line:

   ```local.properties
   API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
   ```

4. **Build and Run the Project**

   Use Gradle to build and run the project:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew run
   ```

   For Android, open the project in Android Studio and run the application from there.

## Using BuildKConfig

MovieNow uses [BuildKConfig](https://github.com/yshrsmz/BuildKonfig) to centralize and manage the app configuration. The API key specified in `local.properties` is injected into the project via BuildKConfig plugin during build time.

- Ensure the `local.properties` file contains your API key.
- Verify that the KConfig setup in your `build.gradle.kts` or other configuration files is correctly reading the `API_KEY` property.
